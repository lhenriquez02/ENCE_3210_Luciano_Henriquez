In the 3d model of the PCB, you'll notice that one of the components clips the pin sockets of the Arduino, but this would not happen if the pin sockets were instead pin headers like when we designed our thermos pro shield. Unfortunately, I was unable to change the 3d model for the Arduino uno pin components, as I could not find a way to interact with the component on the PCB editor at all. Rest assured, this would not be an issue if the pin sockets were headers instead. We have direct control over the components we choose to add to the board, so this in principle would not arise if the design were sent to the fab house.
